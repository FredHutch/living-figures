A "living figure" is a file which contains both the data and the code which can transform it into a visualization. 

Living figures give you the ability to interact with data in complex ways directly in your web browser, without
having to install anything on your computer. 

**Easily save your work**

After you've tweaked your visualization settings, or uploaded your own data, you can easily save a copy of your work.

When you open that file, the figure will launch with all of your changes saved.

**Why do living figures take so long to load?**

Living figures run by installing all of their Python dependencies directly into your web browser. This usually takes 15 to 25 seconds.

Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages by researchers. It provides powerful functionality for manipulating and visualizing complex data sets. 

**Living figures are free and open**

By running entirely inside your web browser, living figures don't require any servers or subscriptions.

You can send a living figure to anyone, and be reasonably sure it will start right up.

**You can make your own living figures**

The Python library used to create living figures can be found at [github.com/FredHutch/widgets](https://github.com/FredHutch/widgets).

By following some of the examples here, it should be possible to turn your visualization into a living figure.

If you'd like to share it with others, please be in touch.
