The incredible diversity of microbial life is not only driven by the different genes in their genomes,
but also by the chemical structure of the DNA which encodes those genes -- their "epigenome."  
The Pan-Epigenome Browser makes it easy to compare the epigenetic modifications from a group of
organisms, identifying important patterns to learn something new about the microbial world.

**Background**  
There are many different reasons why epigenetic modifications may be important for the biology
of a particular bacterial strain:
