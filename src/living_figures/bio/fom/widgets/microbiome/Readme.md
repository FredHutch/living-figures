# Microbiome

Analysis of the taxonomic composition of a mixture of microbes is
referred to generally as 'microbiome' analysis.  
This is a type of FOM where each feature is a type of microbe
(usually a taxonomic annotation), the sample is a biological specimen,
and the observation is the (relative) abundance of that organism
in that particular sample.
